<h1>Do You Have A Ticket Project 🎟️ </h1>
Do you have a ticket? co-workers, friends, family members. If they want you to fix an IT problem they have to have a ticket. If grandma needs help with her cell phone? Ticket. Netflix isn’t working on your mom's TV? Ticket. If the printer isn’t working in the office? Ticket. 

 ### 

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of creation of a help desk software, Peppermint, and the the general overview of getting it setup and the interface navigation. I use Linode to setup Peppermint, a self hosted ticket software. I then demonstrate Peppermint various functions.
